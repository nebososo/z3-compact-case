# z3-compact-case

A modified version of a 3D printable case for a Sony Xperia Z3 Compact
smartphone [original on thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:714570).

- No need to take off the cover to charge anymore (with the regular charger).
- Protect the back (with a rectangle cut for the camera)
- Much thicker (for added protection)
- Tigher fit, so your phone won't fall off
- More room for your fingers when pressing the buttons

# Build Instructions

Use OpenSCAD to turn this into an STL file, do whatever you do to print STL
files.

# Assembly and Usage

I printed mine on an UP Plus 2 with 1.5mm layer height, but the original
creator used something else and gave more details (check the repository I
forked from).
